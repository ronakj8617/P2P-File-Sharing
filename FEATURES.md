# P2P File Sharing System - Features

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Distributed Architecture
- **Tracker Server**: Central coordinator that maintains peer registry
- **Peer Nodes**: Act as both client and server simultaneously
- **Decentralized File Transfer**: Direct peer-to-peer file transfers

### 2. File Chunking System
- Files split into 512KB chunks for efficient transfer
- Parallel downloads from multiple peers
- Resume capability (download only missing chunks)
- Chunk integrity maintained throughout transfer

### 3. Multithreaded Operations
- **Tracker**: One thread per client connection
- **Peer Server**: Handles multiple incoming requests concurrently
- **Peer Client**: Parallel downloads from multiple peers
- Thread-safe operations with proper synchronization

### 4. Network Protocol
- Simple text-based protocol for tracker communication
- Binary data transfer for file chunks
- TCP sockets for reliable data transfer
- Error handling and connection management

### 5. File Management
- Binary file I/O operations
- Automatic file reconstruction from chunks
- File size validation and chunk counting
- Support for files of any size

## Technical Implementation

### Tracker Protocol Messages
```
REGISTER <filename> <filesize> <peer_address>  - Register a file
LOOKUP <filename>                              - Find peers sharing file
UNREGISTER <peer_address>                      - Remove peer from tracker
```

### Peer Protocol Messages
```
GET_CHUNK <filename> <chunk_id>                - Request file chunk
Response: <chunk_size>\n<binary_data>          - Chunk data response
```

### Key Classes
- **FileChunkManager**: Handles file chunking and reconstruction
- **Tracker**: Manages peer registry and file metadata
- **Peer**: Implements both client and server functionality
- **Protocol**: Message serialization/deserialization
- **Utils**: Network utilities and file operations

## Performance Features

### Parallel Downloads
- Multiple worker threads download chunks simultaneously
- Round-robin distribution of chunks among available peers
- Automatic load balancing across peer network

### Efficient Memory Usage
- Chunks loaded on-demand
- Streaming file operations
- Minimal memory footprint per connection

### Network Optimization
- TCP socket reuse
- Connection pooling for multiple chunk requests
- Graceful error handling and retry logic

## Extensibility Points

The system is designed for easy extension:

### 1. Security Enhancements
- Add TLS/SSL encryption for secure transfers
- Implement peer authentication
- File integrity verification with checksums

### 2. Advanced Features
- DHT (Distributed Hash Table) for decentralized tracking
- Bandwidth throttling and QoS controls
- Resume downloads across sessions
- Magnet link support

### 3. User Interface
- Web-based management interface
- GUI application with Qt/GTK
- Command-line improvements with progress bars

### 4. Protocol Improvements
- UDP support for faster transfers
- Compression for text files
- Delta sync for file updates

## Build and Deployment

### Requirements
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.16+
- POSIX sockets (Linux/macOS)
- pthreads library

### Build Process
```bash
./build.sh
# or manually:
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

### Deployment
- Single binary for tracker server
- Single binary for peer nodes
- No external dependencies beyond system libraries
- Cross-platform compatible (Linux/macOS)

## Testing and Validation

### Test Files Included
- `test_files/sample.txt` - Small test file
- `test_files/large_sample.txt` - Multi-chunk test file

### Test Scripts
- `demo.sh` - Interactive demonstration
- `test.sh` - Basic connectivity testing

### Manual Testing Process
1. Start tracker server
2. Start multiple peer nodes
3. Share files from one peer
4. Download files to other peers
5. Verify file integrity

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a production-ready P2P file sharing system with room for advanced features and optimizations.
